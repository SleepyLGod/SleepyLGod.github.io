Hi, I am Haodong. Welcome to my personal website. Great pleasure to see you.

**C**urrently, I'm an undergraduate student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) majoring in Computer Science. Almost all my personal experiences are shown in my [resume](https://sleepylgod.github.io/cv/). **M**y research interest is ranging from the distributed system, databases, key-value storage, high performance computing, and any other approach to greatly improve the performance and structure of the software underlying. Of course, application domains including web3 and web development are also what I fancy, though they are also difficult to learn well.

Free feel to reach out to me via email!

Something More About Me
-----------------------

"Stay hungry, stay foolish", that's the sentence Steve Jobs quoted in his speech at the graduation ceremony of Stanford University, which comes from a back cover of a magzine, "Whole Earth Catalog". I love this sentence not only because of the speaker, Jobs, my idol, but because it describes my lifelong goal as well.

"Go on struggling, and go on dream-chasing", this is my explanation of the sentence. We Chinese people emphasize "ren ding sheng tian", which means that we have the power to change the world. In my opinion, stay hungry means not to be complacent about the status quo and constantly pursue progress of yourself, your team and the world, and stay foolish means to stick to your original aspiration and keep working hard for your dreams even if the world thinks your dreams are silly and naive.

Well, I am an extreme perfectionist and a stubborn person, sticking on something continuously if I think it's meaningful. I love computers, I love the melody of fingertips colliding with keyboards, I love the feeling and vision of changing the world with code, I love creation and thinking, and I love being immersed in the world of 0 and 1.
