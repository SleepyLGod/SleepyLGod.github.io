Hi, I am Haodong. Welcome to my personal website. Great pleasure to see you.

**C**urrently, I'm an undergraduate student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) majoring in Computer Science. Almost all my personal experiences are shown in my [resume](https://sleepylgod.github.io/cv/). **M**y research interest is ranging from the distributed system, databases, key-value storage, high performance computing, and any other approach to greatly improve the performance and structure of the software underlying. Of course, application domains including web3 and web development are also what I fancy, though they are also difficult to learn well.

Free feel to reach out to me via email!
