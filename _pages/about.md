Hi, this Haodong (Von). Great pleasure to see you.

**I** am an MPhil student in Computer Science and Engineering Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Eric Lo](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo/). My focus is on LLMSys, DBMS, and K-V Storage. Plus, I'm keen on cutting-edge fields like Blockchain and Web development.

Free feel to reach out to me via [email](mailto:haodong.lu.me@gmail.com)!

### **Something More**

**I** am an extreme perfectionist, sticking to something continuously if I think it's meaningful. Chasing something graceful and powerful will always be my goal, regardless of the difficulty.

**A**dditionally, I crazily enjoy music. I love listening to and creating "delicious" melodies, no matter the type. I am addicted to singing as well as playing some instruments including the electronic piano, the erhu, the bamboo flute, and the guitar. They are always excellent ways to express stress and pursue happiness.
